Hackety Hack 0.8 is here!

h2. Where can I get it?

You can grab a copy of the source "here":http://github.com/steveklabnik/hacketyhack/tree/0.8 .

h2. What works

All of the basic features are in place. With the latest shoes from GitHub, Hackety runs. You can write and run basic programs, and the Try Ruby tutorial works correctly.

h2. What doesn't

The main things that aren't implemented are the website integration stuff and the Lessons and Tables. Also, there aren't any installers at this time.

h2. Where from here?

Well, the first thing that I'll be working on is reverse engineering the website aspects of Hackety. Then, getting some Lessons up, as well as building nice installers for all platforms will be the next top priority.
